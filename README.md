# Business Performance & Revenue Analysis (2022)
**Power BI Dashboard | Mexico-Based Toy Retail Company**

## 1. Business Context

This project analyzes the 2022 business performance of a Mexico-based toy retail company operating multiple physical store locations across the country and offering a diverse product portfolio.

While overall revenue performance appeared strong, management lacked a consolidated and intuitive view of:
- Profitability drivers across products and stores
- Cost behavior throughout the year
- Margin fluctuations and performance inconsistencies

The absence of a centralized analytics view limited the company’s ability to make data-driven strategic decisions.

## 2. Business Problem

Senior leadership required a clear and executive-ready dashboard to address the following challenges:

- Uneven revenue and profit performance across months  
- High sales volume not always translating into high profitability  
- Limited visibility into cost structures by product category  
- Difficulty identifying top and underperforming stores

This report was designed to answer the following key questions:

1. What are total revenue, profit, cost, and profit margin for 2022?  
2. How do revenue and profit evolve month-over-month?  
3. Which product categories generate the highest revenue and profit?  
4. Which store locations and individual stores are the most profitable?  
5. How do costs compare to profits across products and time?  
6. Where are opportunities to improve margins and operational efficiency?

- A limited number of product categories drive a disproportionate share of total revenue.  
- Profit margins peak mid-year and decline toward year-end, indicating potential seasonal cost pressures.  
- The most profitable stores are concentrated in major urban areas, particularly Mexico City and Guadalajara.  
- Some high-revenue product categories exhibit lower profitability, highlighting cost inefficiencies.  
- Certain lower-volume products generate strong profit, representing margin-focused growth opportunities.

- Shift focus from pure revenue growth to margin optimization  
- Review cost structures in underperforming product categories
